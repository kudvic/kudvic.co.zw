                    <h5>Can i provide the fuel for the machinery</h5>

                    <p>Yes you may. You will be charged a 'dry' rate. Please note that we only accept fuel that comes 
                        straight from the pump so as to protect our engines from poor quality fuel.</p>

                    <h5>Can i use my own machine operator / driver</h5>

                    <p>Unfortunately not, we provide experienced operators who have been trained to take good care of the machines.</p>
